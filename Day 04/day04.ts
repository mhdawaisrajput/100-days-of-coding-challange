/*
Question 10 : Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs youâ€™ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
If you donâ€™t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your 
name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

Question 11: Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each personâ€™s name by 
accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

/*
Question 12 : Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, 
print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the 
personâ€™s name.
